I like helping others however i can. So you can use any parts of this project, be it in paid or free projects.
However i do wish you to:
- Provide Credit and link to either the GitHub repo or the Mod-Page. Creating this has taken a lot my free time. I'm already fine with a simple "My project uses parts of PlayerVoiceFramework, see at <mod_url>"
- Not use it for anything malicious. With "malicious" i mean things like malware, or programs that are otherwise intended to cause harm. I did not create this for those purposes.
- Don't hold me accountable for anything that happens due to this project. I do this alone in my free time, i don't have a 100-Person QA Team. Bugs can and will happen.
